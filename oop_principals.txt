Inheritance
------------

Inheritance is process in which one class takes 
on theattribute and method of another. newly formed 
classes are called child classes, and the child classes
are derived from parent classes.

child classes inherit all of the parents attribute and methods but
can also extend and overrites attributes and methods
that are unique to themselves


Polymorphism
-------------

"Many shapes"

We can write the that works on super class, and it will work
with any type of sub classes as well

Givesd a way to use class exactly like its parent,
but each child class keeps its own methods as they are.


Encapsulation
--------------

Encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding the data implementaion.

Instance variables are kept private and accsessor methods
are made public to acheive this. with this, we
restrict the access to public method (getter / setter).

Instance methods can also kept private.


Abstraction
------------

Abstarction can be thought as a natura extension of encapsulation.
Applying abstraction means that each objkect should only expose
a high-level mechanism for using it

This mechanism should hide internal implementation details.
It should only reveal operations relevent for the other objects.
